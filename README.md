Overlay-Blocker
===============

Adblock filter for obtrusive overlay (pop up) elements and various other annoying elements on websites.

The main purpose of this filter is blocking overlay elements that pop up when websites want you to sign in / register, choose a region (even though you clearly entered a specific geographical version of a site with the intention of visiting that geographical version), answer a survey, subscribe to something, etc.
The secondary purpose is to block other slightly less annoying elements that doesn't pop up such as privacy notices' boxes.

This filter won't block EU cookie notices or Adblock warnings. For that, please use <a href="http://prebake.eu/">Prebake</a> and
